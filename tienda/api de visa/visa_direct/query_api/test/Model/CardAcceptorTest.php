/**
 * Query API
 *
 * The Transaction Query API can be used to determine the processing status of a transaction or to retreive the lifecycle of a transaction. This API can be used to check whether a PullFunds, PushFunds or ReverseFunds transaction processed successfully if received by Visa. This API could also be used to retrieve the detailed lifecycle or history of a transaction (e.g. original transaction, chargeback, chargeback reversal etc).
