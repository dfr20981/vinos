/**
 * Visa Alias Directory API
 *
 * Visa Alias Directory Services provide an ability to resolve an identifier (i.e. an alias) such as mobile phone number, email address, short name, or nickname, to a Visa card account (non-Visa soon) through APIs.  A Visa client can use these APIs to allow consumers provide an alias instead of inputting a card number (PAN) to use Visa Direct push payment services such as person-to-person (P2P) money transfers, mVisa merchant payments and mVisa agent deposits and withdrawals.
